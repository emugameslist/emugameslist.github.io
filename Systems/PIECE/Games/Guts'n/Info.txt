Gatsun Imitation

This game is very similar to Gatsun (Kaneko/Kouyusha, 2000).

How to play
Line up three or more germs horizontally to destroy them. Vertical and diagonal lines are not allowed.
Germs can be moved in three directions: shooting left, right, and down.
By clearing the germs in a row, you will get a high score.
You will also get bonus points if you clear all the germs on the screen.
The germs rise from the bottom to the top at a set interval.
When the germs reach the top of the screen, the game ends.
