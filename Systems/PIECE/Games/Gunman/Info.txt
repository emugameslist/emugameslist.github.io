Gunman

It's a game where you watch an apple hanging on a tree start to fall and then shoot it with a gun before it hits the ground.

The game has the following:
The tension of not knowing when the apple will fall
Reflexes from the moment the apple starts to fall until the moment you can shoot it.

Controls
[→]: Take up firing position.
[←]: Return to waiting position.
[A]: Fire.

The basic rules are:
You cannot fire the gun until you are ready to fire.
After you fire, you cannot fire again until you return to the waiting position.
If you are ready to fire and do nothing, the gun will return to the waiting position after a certain amount of time.
If you fire while the apple is falling, the throw counts.
If the apple hits the ground, the throw is lost.
