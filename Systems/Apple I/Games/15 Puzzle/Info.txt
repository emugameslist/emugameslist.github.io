Apple I "15 Puzzle"
Move the letters and achieve alphabetical order.

Most people played this sliding puzzle as a kid already, sometimes after winning it at a local fair. It is the game with 15 square tiles in a square plastic or wooden box. There is one unoccupied free spot and tiles can be moved around and put in the correct order.

First a difficulty level (1 to 5) can be chosen. The prompt where the move can be entered shows the current count of moves.
